# RU-Hackathon

## Inspiration
Revising at the last moment can be difficult. Searching for the topic to revise consumes a lot of time whether it is searching on the laptop, books, or your written notes. Having experienced this difficulty as students, we thought of developing our project MY-REVISER to ease this difficulty and make revision easy and encouraging.

## What it does
A website that stores your notes as images along with descriptions that the student wishes to revise later. The student will then be able to access these notes whenever he wishes to revise those topics that he has stored on the website.
## How we built it
We built the front-end using HTML and CSS. The back end for storing the image along with the description is developed using Python and Django.
